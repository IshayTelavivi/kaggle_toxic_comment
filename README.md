This is my first DL project. It envolves a kaggle competition that ended 5 months before I started it, and I decided to use the competition for practicing NLP with DL.

As I was self learning this topic, I decided on the next several purposes for this project:
1. Run an end to end DL project
2. Learn profoundly and use several algorithms: CNN, LSTM, GRU
3. Try out several network structures
4. Use prelearned embedding (Glove)
5. Use cloud GPU computing (Floydhub)

The project is still in progress.
